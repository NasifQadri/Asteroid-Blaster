# Asteroid-Blaster

Grade 11 CS summative project

Asteroid Blaster is a simple retro-style shooter inspired by Nickervision Studio's 'Bit Blaster XL'. The game is simple in nature, the only goal is to beat your previous score. 

### WARNING:

THE UI AND FONTS WILL BE BROKEN ON SCREENS WITH RESOLUTIONS LOWER THAN 1280x1024 OR SMALL SCREENS SUCH AS LAPTOPS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT TESTEDON ANYTHING SMALLER. MOST FONTS ARE BROKEN ON MAC/LINUX BECAUSE FIXEDSYS IS A WINDOWS FONT
